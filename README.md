These are my experiments code is for me to yolo with it's public only for me to keep as a nagging to-do list.
I suggest you wait until I have fully finished messing with it.

thought of trying some kind of softmax alternative for the first few traing runs to train on more local data 
then use something else to generalise later, idea is focus attention at the start then allow less focused global later, 
but this might be worth trying while decoding, we shall see
